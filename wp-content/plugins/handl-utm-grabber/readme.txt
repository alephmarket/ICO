The easiest (we mean it!) way to capture UTMs on your (optin) forms. Supports: Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms, Ninja Forms, Salesforce, ActiveCampaign.

== Description ==

**Capture all the UTM variables (and more)** as soon as user hits your website (ANY page of your WP installation): One great feature of the plugin is the UTM variables are saved in **client's browser (COOKIES)** and even though there is no UTM variables in URL, the variables can still be accessible via shortcode across any page/widget of your website.

> #### Major features in HandL UTM Grabber include:
>
> * Add hidden fields in your forms (incl. Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms, WordPress-to-lead for Salesforce CRM, Ninja Forms, ActiveCampaign, Caldera Forms, WooCommerce and many more.)
> * Pass UTM variables to major marketing tools such as ActiveCampaign, Vero, Aweber, Interspire and many more...
> * Hassle free implementation (no shortcodes). See below...
