== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to disable the bar on certain pages? =

For now, you will have to use a filter to disable the bar on certain pages. The following example only loads the Top Bar on your blog post pages.

`
add_filter( 'mctb_show_bar', function( $show ) {
	return is_single();
} );
`

Another example, this only loads the bar on your "contact" page.

`
add_filter( 'mctb_show_bar', function( $show ) {
	return is_page('contact');
} );
`

Have a look at the [Conditional Tags](https://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags) page for all accepted functions.

= How to add a name field to the bar? =

You can use the following code snippet to show a "NAME" field in your bar.

`
add_action( 'mctb_before_submit_button', function() {
    echo '<input type="text" name="NAME" placeholder="Your name" />';
});

add_filter( 'mctb_subscriber_data', function( $subscriber ) {
    if( ! empty( $_POST['NAME'] ) ) {
        $subscriber->merge_fields['NAME'] = sanitize_text_field( $_POST['NAME'] );
    }

    return $subscriber;
});
`

**KB:** [Add name field to MailChimp Top Bar](https://mc4wp.com/kb/add-name-field-to-mailchimp-top-bar/)

= How to hide the bar on small screens? =

Adding the following CSS to your site should hide the bar on all screens smaller than 600px. The [Simple Custom CSS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/) plugin is great for adding custom CSS.

`
@media( max-width: 600px ) {
	#mailchimp-top-bar { display: none !important; }
}
`
