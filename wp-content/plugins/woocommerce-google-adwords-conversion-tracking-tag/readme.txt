Track the dynamic order value in AdWords from WooCommerce

== Description ==

This plugin <strong>tracks the value of WooCommerce orders in Google AdWords</strong>. With this you can optimize all your AdWords campaigns to achieve maximum efficiency.

<strong>Highlights</strong>

* Very precise by preventing duplicate reporting effectively, excluding admins and shop managers from tracking, and not counting failed payments.
* Very easy to install and maintain.

<strong>Requirements</strong>

* The payment gateway **must** support on-site payments. If you want to use an off-site payment solution like the free PayPal extension you need to make sure that the visitor is being redirected back to the WooCommerce thankyou page after the successful transaction. Only if the redirection is set up properly and the visitor doesn't stop the redirection, only then the conversion will be counted.
* As this is a free plugin we only support recent versions of WooCommerce, WordPress and PHP. We don't maintain backward compatibility.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin directory into your plugins directory `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Get the AdWords conversion ID and the conversion label. You will find both values in the AdWords conversion tracking code.
4. In the WordPress admin panel go to WooCommerce and then into the 'AdWords Conversion Tracking' menu. Please enter the conversion ID and the conversion label into their respective fields.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I check if the plugin is working properly? =

1. Log out of the shop.
2. Search for one of your keywords and click on one of your ads.
3. Purchase an item from your shop.
4. Wait until the conversion shows up in AdWords.

With the Google Tag Assistant you will also be able to see the tag fired on the thankyou page.

= I get a fatal error and I am running old versions of WordPress and/or WooCommerce. What can I do? =

As this is a free plugin we don't support old version of WordPress and WooCommerce. You will have to update your installation.

= I am using an offsite payment gateway and the conversions are not being tracked. What can I do? =

We don't support if an offsite payment gateway is in use. The reason is that those cases can be complex and time consuming to solve. We don't want to cover this for a free plugin. We do not recommend offsite payment gateways anyway. A visitor can stop the redirection manually which prevents at least some conversions to be tracked. Also offsite payment gateways are generally bad for the conversion rate.

= Where can I report a bug or suggest improvements? =

Please post your problem in the WGACT Support forum: http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-google-adwords-conversion-tracking-tag
You can send the link to the front page of your shop too if you think it would be of help.
